# Bamba
## Mission
Bamba is a collaborative organizational platform geared toward the easy creation and participation of events and sale of equipment in the fishing, hunting, sports and outdoor industries that conform to ethic standards of sustainability and practice.

## Vision
Bamba sees itself being the go-to platform for people interested in hunting and fishing to find events and destinations to fulfil their goals by providing ease of use and social integration with their activities as needed. Through the platform, they should have the ability to book a hunting or fishing trip at any partner in South Africa, as well as buy equipment and stock suggested to them from any supplying partner.

## Goals
Develop an MVP API that can add/remove,update and return venues and sales with as much details as possible including GPS.
Develop a sales consultant application, allowing each sales consultant to add venues to the application if approved and making a bit of income off of that.
Develop a basic front-end web application for venue/event and sales
Use counsel for contracts and agreements added to the application
Add social media integration to the application
Onboard at least 20 venues
Add at least 100 products

## Guiding Principals
Bamba employees strive to improve the platform one day at a time by adding features requested by users from the most important to the least or by fostering better client/user relationships and improving the quality-sale balance.
